### 1. Clone repository from Github :
git clone https://github.com/wailsamjouni/ba_trees.git
### 2. Execute the code :
⋅⋅* Open a Python file
⋅⋅* Create an object of the class Overload
⋅⋅* Call the method compute_paths with the desired parameter by setting the paramerter "version" with one of the algorithms (edps, onetree, multitree)
